# Introduction to Repls

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop - however, the function of REPLs at Repl.it has
outgrown that definition.  Capable of doing much more, Repls are the workspaces that
Repl.it users interface with whenever they use the app.

A Repl at Repl.it is an interactive programming environment.  You can create a workspace
in any number of languages, where you are given a container on a virtual machine where
your code can run, sandboxed. In any given repl, there are two main parts - the editor
and the console.

The editor uses [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/),
the same technology that powers Visual Studio Code.  On mobile, the editor is
[Ace](https://ace.c9.io/).

The console is where the standard output will appear, and where you will be prompted to
enter standard input.  In most languages, the console doubles as a repl - you can evaluate
snippets of code interactively, and in [some cases](site/docs/repls/files), you can interact with
variables that have been defined in your main body of code.

Read on to see what Repls are capable of.
