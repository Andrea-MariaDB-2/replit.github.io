## Different Types

**Private repls:**

- These can only be accessed via people in your team that are members (and guests directly invited to these repls)
- You can make a repl private when you initially create it.

**Public repls:**

- Can be accessed by anyone who has the url to the repl.
- They can fork and copy everything on the repl, so a great way to share code with people outside of the team.
- No one can edit the original repl unless they are on the team.
