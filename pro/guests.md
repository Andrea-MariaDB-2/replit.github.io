## Interviewing Candidates

The best way to do this would be to use our guest feature. The amount of guests you have will not impact your seats as they are limited to only the repls they are invited to and cannot acces anything else in the broader team.

Steps:

- All you will need to do is go to the repl the candidate/contractor etc. will work off of.
- Once there look at the top right and click on the invite button.
- Through the modal you have the option to invite someone with guest role by sharing with them a link or directly inviting them via their username or email address.
