# Teams Pro
A new and revolutionary approach to work and interviews. Teams Pro is a shared repo for your entire team (and candidates) to collaborate and build with.

It is built around four corner stones:
- Build:
   - You can program and dogfood anything from a small script to building out a full mvp.
   - It allows your team to focus on just programming and nothing else.
   - You can interview candidates --> We have a guest mode that makes this streamlined and easy to do
   - Connect to github --> You can also connect and push or pull all your code to and from github

   

- Collaborate:
   - Threads --> Allows you to have asynrchonous conversations across all repls so knowledge and conversations are never lost. You can highlight specific lines of code or writing and have separate converstations.

   - Multiplayer -- > You can work together on any repl as a team all at once live or at different times. Great way to knowledge share and debug or just build.

   - Who is coding? -- > A live look on what your team is working on which allows for teammates to jump in and out of repls to help out or give input as needed

- Host:
   - Create internal tools --> slack bots, web services, lunch roulette, data processing, scrapers, etc.

   - If you use always on with hosting you can spin up your blogs, docs, scripting tools, etc. in unprecedented speed

- Fun
   - Teams pro really allows team work to turn into dream work. 
   - Markdown gives you all so much power --> You can do everything from meeting minutes and post mortems to user interviews
   - You can also whiteboard using draw files (.draw)

   - Combine the two and it is a great way to create design docs and brainstorming sessions.
   - You can also use it as a knowledebase (one source of truth for the whole team)
