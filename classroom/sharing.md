# Classroom Sharing

Many of our teachers are creating high quality and easily re-usable content --
so we're making it easy to share classrooms with other teachers.

It works just like [cloning](site/docs/classroom/management?id=cloning-classrooms) in that it copies all the
instructional material, code, files, and unit tests into a new classroom, except
the owner would be the teacher you're sharing the classroom with.

Sharing classrooms is simple: from your [teacher dashboard](https://repl.it/teacher) click on
the menu button (â‹®) and select 'Share'. We'll then provide a link that you can
use to share your classroom, or you can enter emails to share with.

*Note that assignments will be in draft status in the cloned classroom*

In the future, we'll also introduce sharing on a more granular level -- namely:
assignments.
