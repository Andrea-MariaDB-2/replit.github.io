[Teams for Education](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) is Repl.it's new plan for students and teachers, learners and educators. Please read our recent [blog post](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) for more details.

In these docs, we'll outline current and planned workflows to teach using Repl.it. We'll be updating and adding more detail over time.

Now you can create your first team repl! Any team repl will automatically add your students and fellow teachers for seamless multiplayer collaboration.

## Inviting people to your team

Follow the steps during team creation to invite people with their repl.it username or email addresses.

If you've already created a team, go to the team dashboard and under "Teammates" click "Add more."

## Assignment creation and submission

*Note: this is just a summary of the process. We will be releasing this workflow in August 2020.*

From the team dashboard create a new template. In the template, add any comments and the initial code building blocks that you'd like your students to start from.

When your template is ready to be published, click share from the IDE, or set it to published from your teams dashboard

Students will be able to fork the template and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and the team admins can see their work. This keeps all student submissions private and prevents plagiarism.

When the students are done they can mention you on their finished repl to have you review and grade their work.
