# Teams for Education [BETA]

##### Note that teams for education is currently in beta. If you are interested in getting started, you can [create a team here](https://repl.it/teams).

[Teams for Education](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) is Repl.it's new plan for students and teachers, learners and educators. Please read our recent [blog post](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) for more details.

In these docs, we'll outline current and planned workflows to teach using Repl.it. We'll be updating and adding more detail over time.

## Creating a team

Sign up for a [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) account.

Click on [teams](https://repl.it/teams) in the left sidebar, then click on create a team.

Now you can create your first team repl! Any team repl will automatically add your students and fellow teachers for seamless multiplayer collaboration.

## Inviting people to your team

Follow the steps during team creation to invite people with their repl.it username or email addresses.

If you've already created a team, go to the team dashboard and under "Teammates" click "Add more."

## Assignment creation and submission

*Note: this is just a summary of the process. We will be releasing this workflow in August 2020.*

From the team dashboard create a new template. In the template, add any comments and the initial code building blocks that you'd like your students to start from.

When your template is ready to be published, click share from the IDE, or set it to published from your teams dashboard

Students will be able to fork the template and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and the team admins can see their work. This keeps all student submissions private and prevents plagiarism.

When the students are done they can mention you on their finished repl to have you review and grade their work.

## Instructional material

You can add arbitrary files to your repl, which means you can add PDFs, images, or any supplemental material. However, we recommend to start your students off with a README.md a file. It's the standard documentation and entry-point file for code repositories and when Repl.it sees that file it will render it first. Here is an [example repl with a README](https://repl.it/@amasad/python-with-readme).

## Testing and assesments

Since Repl.it is a general-purpose IDE that supports third-party packages in many languages, you can integrate testing frameworks into your projects which can be used for assesments. 

We've written a tutorial for how to do testing in Python using PyTest that you can read [here](https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/09-test-driven-development).
