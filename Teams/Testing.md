## Testing, assesments, and autograding

Since Repl.it is a general-purpose IDE that supports third-party packages in many languages, you can integrate testing frameworks into your projects which can be used for assesments. 

We've written a tutorial for how to do testing in Python using PyTest that you can read [here](https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/09-test-driven-development).

Autograding resources and forkable/copyable templates (templates are currently written in Python but we will be adding support for additional languages):
- [Simple autograding](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/SimpleAutograding)
- [Fully automated autograding](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/CentralizedAutograder)
