## Project creation and submission

From your team dashboard, create a new project. **Select project language, title, description, and whether this will be a group project.**  You'll be redirected to the IDE to add any comments, tests, and initial coding blocks you'd like your students to start from.

## Publishing

When you are done editing your project and it is ready to be published, click "Publish project" from the IDE.

A modal appears, where you can toggle the project between "Published" and "Unpublished".

**For individual projects**, students are able to fork the project and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and team admins can see and edit their work.

**For group projects**, you must assign students into submission groups to collaborate.  Click "Auto Assign" to automatically assign all students into equal groups.  You can add and remove new groups, drag and drop students between groups, and search for students. 

Click "Save" to finalize any changes, or "Cancel" to discard.

## Submitting

When the students are done they click "Submit" in the IDE header, which will notify all team admins of their submission.
